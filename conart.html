          <p>Design of the website features various shapes in bright colours. There's also a paper texture applied to the background and shapes, which with the addition of gradient adds depth to the design. While the website contains a lot of elements of different colours, they are carefully placed to leave some breathing space and room for text. </p>
          <p>Bright colours are a great pair with black texts, creating needed contrast and making the website more interesting. Notably, the shapes were omitted where images appear (see: About page) to keep the design clean. Font called El Messiri was used. A serif font was picked for this project, because it pairs well with the topic (museum website). Besides, it also help the website stand out more with all other companies using sans-serif typefaces. </p>
