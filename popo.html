          <p>The logo was made in simplicity in mind. Enclosed in a square and by retaining symmetry, it looks pleasing, and it's not overwhelming. A shadow effect adds a little more depth to the desing, and it's used across other products to create a cutout effect. The logo was presented in four different iterations as a way to easily show the colour scheme.</p>
          <p>Colours used are all pastel, which fits the cosmetic packaging really well. It's perfectly shown in the containers for day and night cream, with the first one using yellow and pink, and the second one utilising blue and yellow. It uses basic instintcs (light colour to symbolize day and dark to symbolize night), helping the customer find themselves during a variety of different products among the shelves.</p>
