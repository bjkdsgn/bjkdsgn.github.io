          <p>The stylization and make up done in the studio were made so that the actress would look like a statue resembling Hail Mary. With sad eyebrows, long eyelashes and fake tears made using a simple glue resulted in a stunning result.</p>
          <p>Moody lighting, as well as blue and red filters used on the lamps in the studio helped establishing the mood and colour scheme of the show. That design appears on a cover of the NME magazine created especially for Petrichor.</p>
